# Phylogenetic combinatorics in Haskell

I implemented some function to enumerate basic phylogenetic quantities I encounter in my work with `Haskell`. 
These include _coalescent histories_, _ancestral configurations_, and _labeled histories_.

The code is naive without crazy optimizations or tricks.
